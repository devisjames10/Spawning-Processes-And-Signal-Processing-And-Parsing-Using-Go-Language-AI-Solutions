# Spawning-Processes-and-Signal-Processing-Using-Go-AI-Solutions
Go is a programming language created at Google in 2009. Go is a statically typed compiled language in the tradition of C, with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrent programming features added. Sometimes our Go programs need to spawn other, non-Go processes. For example, the syntax highlighting on this site is implemented  by spawning a pygmentize process from a Go program. Letâ€™s look at a few examples of spawning processes from Go. Basic sends and receives on channels are blocking. However, we can use select with a default clause to implement non-blocking sends,  receives, and even non-blocking multi-way selects.
